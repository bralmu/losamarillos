Los Amarillos S.L. is a regional bus company that doesn't have a bus schedule table available online. However they do have an online ticket selling service so lets do some hacking to obtain their buses schedule.

For now it extracts origins and destinations and saves them to a local sqlite DB. Pending:
 * Extract more data (times and prices).
 * Generate an HTML table showing all schedule and prices.
 * Generate an interactive map showing bus schedule.
